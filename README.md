## ðŸ§© Abstract

This research addresses urban waste challenges by proposing a mobile-based garbage collection system integrated with IoT-enabled smart bins. It aims to modernize traditional waste collection methods with real-time monitoring, route optimization, bulk waste scheduling, complaint management, and an organic fertilizer storeâ€”bringing environmental sustainability, operational efficiency, and community engagement to the forefront of smart waste management.
